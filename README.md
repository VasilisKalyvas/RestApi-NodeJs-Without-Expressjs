# RestApi with NodeJs But wthout Expressjs.

In this Project I build a Rest Api without using Expressjs.
In my previous projects I build all the Rest Apis with Express 
so I couldnt build one without express.
On the occasion of a test given to me from an interview 
where this project was requested I tried to learn how to build it 
after my failure in the test.

Features:
1. Crud operations for products.
2. Ascending/Descending operation by the price of product.
